For a balance, Mr. Olafsson took a scholarship in the United States to study physics, writing a book of short stories along the way.    When Mr. Olafsson's mentor at Brandeis University heard that he was considering a career outside physics, he introduced Mr. Olafsson to a physicist who had made the \"mistake\" of going into business. He was Michael Schulhof, then chairman of strategic planning for the Sony Corporation of America, and now its president and chief executive. But instead of convincing Mr. Olafsson to stay in academics, Mr. Schulhof offered him a job.
